<H2>Introduction to the Problem</H2>
<b>Audience – My intended audience would be policy makers, concerned citizens, environmental enthusiasts, and anyone that is concerned about the socioeconomic effects of recent global climate events.
Goals/KPIs – My main goals are: to track the scale/effects of climate events to help policy makers make appropriate changes, highlight socioeconomic impact of different events over time, and to identify trends in the data such as hotspots, frequent events based on area, and maybe identify response gaps and how they can be improved. The KPI’s I will use to track these goals include: Top 5 event types chosen by economic impact or casualties, average response_time_hours per type of event, total number of events in total or by country, total economic impact by region</b>
